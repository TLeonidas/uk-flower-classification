# UK Flower Classification with Deep Learning ðŸŒº

This repository hosts a trained deep learning model for classifying 102 species of UK endemic flowers by building a custom classifier on top of a VGG16-based neural network. The model achieves 85% validation accuracy.

**Dataset:** [Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)

**Trained Model:** Available in this repository (`checkpoint.pth`)

## **Installation & Setup**
To get started, simply download the *setup.sh* file, change the working directory to where the file was downloaded, and run the following code:
```bash
cd <path_to_the_downloaded_file>
bash setup.sh
```
## Running Inference
**After running setup.sh, classify a flower image:**
```bash
python predict.py <your_img_path/image.jpg> --gpu
```
