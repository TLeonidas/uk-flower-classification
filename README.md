# UK Flower Classification with Deep Learning ðŸŒº

This repository hosts a trained deep learning model for classifying 102 species of UK endemic flowers, using a custom-built classifier on top of a VGG16-based neural network. The model achieves 85% validation accuracy.

This project was developed as the final project for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree by Udacity. The trained model is hosted for inference, allowing users to classify flower species using an image.

**Dataset:** [Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)

**Trained Model:** Available in this repository (`checkpoint.pth`)

**Model Architecture:** VGG16-based with a custom classifier
