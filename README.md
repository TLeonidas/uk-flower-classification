# UK Flower Classification with Deep Learning ü™∑

This repository hosts my final project for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program by Udacity, earned through a scholarship from AWS.

## Project Overview
The project trains a deep learning model to classify images of 102 flower species in [this dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) using transfer learning with a VGG16 or ResNet50 convolutional neural network.

## Features
‚úî Transfer learning using VGG16 and ResNet50  
‚úî PyTorch implementation  
‚úî Command-line training & inference (`train.py`, `predict.py`)  
‚úî 85% validation accuracy
